# projectTwo
 When asked about community, I quickly came to the conclusion that I wanted this project to be about the people I hold closest to me. And the person I hold closest to me, is my girlfriend. This song is special to me becuase she often played it when we first started dating and I thought it was very sweet whenever it came on. Two years later, the song still comes on every so often and it brings a smile to my face seeing where our relationship is now. I picked my favorite lyrics and tried to keep my site simple, and sweet. I enjoyed figueing out animations and transformations and this was perfect practice for learning how to appply those techniques.
